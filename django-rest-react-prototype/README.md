## Simple test application for React and Django REST

Tutorial from https://www.valentinog.com/blog/drf/
<br/>

To run this, you will need a python environment with djangorestframework <br/>
Activate your virtual environment and run
```pip install djangorestframework```

<br/>
<br/>

Once that is done, with your environment activated, run
```python manage.py runserver```

if you want to make changes to the front end, simply go to the frontend folder and open your terminal in that folder and write ```npm run dev``` this command should be written each time you make changes to the frontend code to updated changes
*Note: if this command does not work for you, try installing npm/babel/webpack/react in the root folder of the project
